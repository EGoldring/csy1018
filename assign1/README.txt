15/12/2016 - I have created a basic navigation bar and left aside
as well as include two Google fonts, create two icons and
also find a royalty free image I can use as my portrait.
Time spent - 3 Hours

16/12/2016 - I have added the rest of the layout for the site. I have
created the CV webpage and filled the page with the required content.
Time spent - 3 Hours

20/12/2016 - I have completed the contact page which includes a contact form.
I have also made some slight changes to the CSS which makes the footer stay on
the bottom of the page.
Time spent - 3 Hours

2/01/2017 - I have populated bio.html and removed Portfolio from the navbar on
all pages.
Time spent - 1 Hour

2/01/2017 - I have added some media queries in the CSS for mobile devices. I
only needed to change the navbar text size in the smaller screen resolutions.
Time spent - 1 Hour

2/01/2017 - I have added links to all the pages, made slight changes to the CSS
and I have optimised my images for the web.

03/01/2017 - I have validated and tested my website.
Time spent - 2 Hours

During final testing and validation of my website I received these errors:

1.      Error: Bad value https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Condensed|Ubuntu for attribute href on element link: Illegal character in query: | is not allowed.
From line 7, column 5; to line 7, column 98 <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Condensed|Ubuntu" rel="stylesheet">
Syntax of URL:
Any URL. For example: /hello, #canvas, or http://example.org/. Characters should be represented in NFC and spaces should be escaped as %20. Common non-alphanumeric characters other than ! $ & ' ( ) * + - . / : ; = ? @ _ ~ generally must be percent-encoded. For example, the pipe character (|) must be encoded as %7C.

2.      Error: Element navbar not allowed as child of element header in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)
From line 13, column 7; to line 13, column 29 <navbar class="navbar">
Content model for element header:
Flow content, but with no header, footer, or main element descendants.

I am unsure on what I can do to solve these errors as I cannot change the link for my Google Fonts and I thought that using "navbar" as the element
for my navigation was correct.
