        <h3 class="cv-subheadings">Skills</h3>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          I have honed my ICT skills including building
          computers and developing software. I can work
          in a pressured environment and can work with
          new people very easily. I worked as a team
          during my apprenticeship which has increased
          my skills at getting my point across while
          also listening to other people and taking
          their points of view into consideration.
            <br />
          My apprenticeship allowed me to meet and work
          with new people, and also taught me to deal
          with customers which I find to be an
          incredibly useful skill. I also worked a 15
          hour shift when helping to set up an event
          in a mall in London, this helped me realise
          my strength and endurance while lifting
          heavy objects, however this also helped me
          to work easier in a busy environment.
        </p>
        <h3 class="cv-subheadings">Employment</h3>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          I have worked with my father on several
          occasions for a week each time – mostly the
          passenger in his tipper truck but I still
          helped with the rear door and safety checks
          when on a tip. I have also helped my uncle
          at work in his workshop with my brother and
          father doing odd jobs like cleaning, making
          tea and coffee and also organising the
          workshop.
             <br />
          Junior Web Developer at Rocket-Creative:
          My employment with Rocket started on the
          1st July 2014 and ended on the 29th September
          2015. I have worked as a Junior
          Web-developer and as a Graphic Designer.
            <br />
          I currently work with B&M Retail in Nene
          Valley, Northampton. My employment with
          B&M started in June 2016 after several
          weeks of work experience with the store.
          I have been trained on the cash register,
          the shop floor and warehouse, I am also
          being trained as a cash office supervisor
          . I was eventually moved from shop floor
          to the checkouts after finishing my work
          experience due to my customer service
          skills. After a month on the checkouts
          I was offered the opportunity to be
          trained as a cash office supervisor
          which I gladly accepted.
        </p>
        <h3 class="cv-subheadings">Interests and Hobbies</h3>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          My main interests lie with computing and
          culture and music. I am interested and pursue
          knowledge in computers in both hardware and
          software. My interest of culture extends into
          several countries, although the most
          prevalent is Japanese culture. My interest
          of music is throughout many different genres
          and styles. I have always had a great
          interest in engineering and love to think
          about how to improve efficiency of certain
          items.
               <br />
          My hobbies include: playing the bass guitar
          and the 6-string guitar; researching and
          keeping up to date on the new computer
          hardware and also meeting up with friends.
          I also enjoy building computers and upgrading
          my own and my friends’ PC, while also helping
          with technical problems they may have. While
          building computers I am always cautious about
          safety of myself and the computer, however I
          am successful in improving the efficiency and
          specifications of the computer, this can keep
          the costs to a minimum and allow for more
          customisation and personalisation.
